<h3>
  Visual Analytics for Social Business
</h3>
<p>
  Understanding deeper insights of social collaboration in an enterprise environment is really important when generating value from social business transformation. Visualizing social collaboration activities and insights can help people in the enterprise to do a better job in this dynamic economic environment. We are going to use several examples to demonstrate how visual analytics technologies help people to understand and explore what is happening in a social business environment, and help them to make decisions and change behavior. The examples will include but are not limited to: dynamic visualization of community evolution; a visual dashboard that offers rapid insight into the TwitterSphere and visualization of important employee topics and related sentiment from unstructured text data in social media.
